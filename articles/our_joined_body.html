                <h1>Our joined body then was his</h1>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        Quite contradict'ry tragedy and time<br>
                        Now seem, for one begins and time now lacks<br>
                        A means to still proceed. You can't relax<br>
                        Without the fear this is the paradigm<br>
                        By which we live: where life itself can steal<br>
                        To end some timeless struggle understood<br>
                        By only them who've spilt their precious blood.<br>
                        It seems we all are pawns of this surreal<br>
                        Phenomenon—not conservation just<br>
                        Of mass and energy, emotion too,<br>
                        For all the tears of all his friends and you<br>
                        Were once contained within just him, our guest<br>
                        Who's now relieved his noble struggle to<br>
                        Protect from those he loved the hurt within...<br>
                        So much I wish he'd seen that friends and kin<br>
                        Would surely help his pains from mind dequeue.<br>
                        <br>
                        I hate that when we've scapegoats quick we blame<br>
                        But when we have ourselves, we all dissolve<br>
                        The guilt inside with helpless hope to solve<br>
                        What turmoil ment'ly lurks without a name.<br>
                        <br>
                        This man's decision, his to make, is real.<br>
                        Now all us individ'ly must decide<br>
                        To bleed or heal and cope with suicide.<br>
                        But when the days that slowly pass just feel<br>
                        Absurd, we must remember all our friends<br>
                        And hope together we can make some sense<br>
                        Of this. To love, to hurt without defense,<br>
                        To wonder why–with help the darkness ends<br>
                        For all are filled with pieces come from him.<br>
                        Alone these pieces might of sadness be,<br>
                        But brought together by us all we'll see<br>
                        That when a great man dies, from mind and limb<br>
                        His soul's deprived. Yet when in mem'ry came<br>
                        Us all to congregate, I saw that our<br>
                        Joined body then was his for one last hour.<br>
                        In friendly minds and souls he died in fame.<br>
                        <br>
                        To love now's more incentive, twofold gain:<br>
                        To be the force which holds the pieces tight <br>
                        Of all our loved ones buried out of sight, <br>
                        And to ensure our living friends remain.
