                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>While working in Dr. Prausnitz's Drug Delivery Lab at Georgia Tech, one of my responsibilities was to perform
                    histological analysis of our experiments on animal tissue. One machine I used was the confocal microscope.</p>
                <p>A confocal microscope functions by emitting a laser through a fluorescently stained sample on a microscope slide and scanning
                    the transmittance of light onto the microscope's sensor. The transmittance is mathematically converted
                    into absorbance to generate the final image.</p>

                    <h4><a href="https://imb.uq.edu.au/facilities/microscopy/2020-microscopy-resources/image-capture/confocal-techniques">

                </div>
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>A confocal microscope can generate a 3D model by taking multiple images from the same slide at different focuses. This is called a Z-Stack. However,
                    the size of this 3D model is limited by how large of a sample can fit on the microscope slide. After about 50-100 um (that's 0.05 to 0.1 mm),
                    too much light is occluded by the sample to make a ZStack. Our samples were ~1.5cm, about <b>100x</b> this limit.</p>
                <h2>My solution</h2>
                <p><b>To obviate this issue, I presented the idea that if we take images of multiple tissue samples across multiple slides, I could write
                    an application to align the images and generate the model myself. My proposal was approved, and this project was born.</b></p>
                <h1>Input</h1>
                <p>The input to my application was a series of microscope images with <b>different size, rotation, and aligment</b> but
                    sharing the same magnification. An example collection of such images is provided below.</p>
                <div class="dashed img_wrapper">
                    <img src="../assets/slide_aligner/aligner_input.png" alt width="1000" height="565"/>
                    <h4>An example set of four input images. Each model was made from 40-60 images compiled together.</h4>
                </div>
                <h1>Processing</h1>
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>The biggest challenge here was the sheer size of the images (for certain reasons, it was necessary to keep the
                    full resolution output from the microscope for other purposes, even though the 3D models did not require the full resolution).
                    I was dealing with approx. 300GB of images (disk-size, not size in memory) that needed to be rotated,
                    aligned, cropped, and ultimately compiled into their models. The issue was that I did not have access to a computer with enough RAM to hold all the images for one model in memory simultaneously,
                    a necessary requirement for ensuring the alignment was satisfactory.
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>My innovation to get around this issue was to
                    instead align small thumbnail-sized versions of the images within my application and save the rotations, translations, and cropping
                    for the small set of images. Then, I could programmatically scale those operations up to the full size images and
                    process them overnight with a simple script.</p>
                <h2>GUI Application (in Java)</h2>
                <p>Borrowing some code from my level editors for <a href="us.html">Us</a> and <a href="quandom.html">Quondam</a>, I wrote an
                    application with a GUI in which the user can align the thumbnail-sized images together and save the transformations
                    necessary for aligning the full-scale images.</p>
                <div class="dashed img_wrapper">
                    <img src="../assets/slide_aligner/aligner-1.png" alt width="1000" height="565"/>
                    <h4>Two images unaligned. The selected image in blue, and the adjacent image in red.</h4>
                    <img src="../assets/slide_aligner/aligner-2.png" alt width="1000" height="565"/>
                    <h4>The same to images after translation and rotation.</h4>
                </div>
                <h2>Large-scale Processing</h2>
                <p>To apply the transformation commands determined by the GUI Application shown above, I wrote a relatively simple
                    MATLAB script making use of MATLAB's wonderfully optimized Image Processing Toolbox. The code still took
                    many, many hours to run, but mostly due to the slow read/write times from disk compared to the processing times.</p>
                <h1>Final Product</h1>
                <p>After all the processing in my Java application and MATLAB script, a selection of now-aligned images could form
                    an animated GIF showing the change in the x-y image over a change in the third axis, z.</p>

                    <h4>An animated GIF showing the final aligned series of confocal images.</h4>
                </div>
                <h2>Generation of voxel model</h2>
                <p>Finally, by making use of the python package 'napari' and implementing something similar to Lorensen and Cline's
                    marching cubes algorithm, a voxel model could be created to view the collection of images in 3D space. The model
                    was colored blue to help improve visibility.</p>
