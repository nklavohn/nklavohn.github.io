                <h1>A quick note</h1>
                <p>I've been working on this novel since the summer of 2019 in my forever-fleeting spare time. The writing of this
                    novel takes on an increasingly important role in my life as a way of trying to make sense of the things which
                    trouble me.</p>

                <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
                <div class="writing_wrapper">
                    <p>	Despair laughs down on the world with its desolate gray glow, and as the chilly nighttime air blows through me, it chills my disposition. I am lonely. Typical. And it sure doesn’t help to have a pounding headache, an unfortunate side effect to the damn hat I wear to help me work more efficiently. Everyone wears them if they can afford them.
                	I’m standing at a decrepit bus stop with a few dour, hatted strangers. All of us have without doubt just left another long day (and part of the damn night) in one of the many ugly city office buildings where we followed the orders of some other hatted stranger we called our boss, who in turn was just following the orders of some other hatted stranger up a big long chain of commands to one hatted idiot on top who’s probably no more skilled than anyone else in the company but runs the thing anyways. Nobody says anything about it. It’s just how it is.</p><p>
                	Nobody says much of anything at all anymore. Not really, you know? Nothing of substance or value. That’s what I really miss: a good conversation. But hell, I’d take just about anything I can get right now. Maybe everyone refrains from speaking their mind because their brains are over-labored and exhausted from the electrical strain of hat-aided work, or because they are afraid of external disapproval in a world where status and reputation is paramount, or because they are so lost in their own thoughts that rush in after a day of pushing them aside that it’s difficult to stay engaged in a conversation. Maybe there are others who just hold back because everyone else does. Has the Stagnation really changed people so much that worries of money prevent thought of anything else? And why has it been so much worse the past few months? Gosh, I don’t know. I wish I did, or at least that the issue would just remedy itself. I’d wager the quiet is mostly due to exhaustion from work. We work so damn much, powered by our corporate-mandated electric hats that make us focus or think better or whatever. It’s just work work work, always without break, conversing purely about company matters and even then only when strictly necessary and not efficient through digital means. It’s so tiring. So tiring, and honestly, I think using a device to electrically or magnetically force your mind to work all day and shove out distractions is probably unhealthy. They tell us it’s not, that other than the occasional headache like the one I have now, there are no other temporary side effects let alone permanent ones. I believe it most of the time, if for no other reason than for the convenience of peace of mind. But regardless of medical side effects, it’s really no wonder when you finally turn off the hat for good that the day's neglected thoughts, deprived and hungry as they are, rush back in to consume your mind. Surely I’m not the only one? But I don’t know.</p><p>
                	People just don’t talk anymore. Maybe we all got tired of talking about groceries being expensive and not having enough money to go around; or did you hear So-and-so’s husband lost his job? They’re not going to make it without both of their salaries; or wonderishly reminiscing in the days before when we’d go out to eat with friends on Friday nights at nice restaurants and see a concert on Saturday -- you know, when we could spend on leisure and stuff; or saying you liked the subtle design on a coworkers belt when they wore the same one several times a week for years because they can’t afford to buy a new one. What’s the point in repeating all that? Perhaps it is easier to not talk at all than to talk of hardship. But damn how I miss even a pointless conversation, a sense of humor, and someone to join me in trading roles as speaker and listener to offer a momentary reprieve from Sadness’s vigil. When did all that stop? Why have these past few months been so much worse?</p><p>
                	A car squeals past the three of us at the bus stop going far faster than it has any right to be going. I turn to the hatted strangers and joke that all the drivers are such assholes, but hey, I’d probably do the same thing if I could afford a car. I guess I was trying to lighten my mood or maybe even their's by starting a conversation. I’m not sure. It wasn’t funny or anything, I just wanted to talk. But those hatted assholes just kept on looking forward, smoking their cigarettes like I had never said anything at all, staring blankly at the grayscale city landscape as if it had subtly changed since yesternight or had ever been interesting to look at in the first place. The ignorance makes me feel awkward, and I am suddenly aware I am a Mind stuck in a Body, as if I can see my Body standing there from an external perspective. I hate when people don’t respond. Hate it. As the silence continues, the discomfort leads me to fumble into my pocket to escape to a cigarette, obligatorily opening my mouth to say something else to try again to start a conversation or to ask about their hats. I decide against it.</p><p>
                    I look away and focus on the plastic side wall of the covered bus stop that has a peeling advertisement for Top Hat, the company that makes these damn hats. ‘Try our Performance Booster Technology. Rise to the Top!’, it says over a picture of a gorgeous model. I can’t get away from them, it makes me sick. The hats are everywhere, well everywhere except in the poor parts of town. But it’s not safe there.</p><p>
                	Strangely, I suddenly realize that the strangers’ hats are turned on and the white indicator light behind their right ears is oscillating. They have different models than my hat, much newer and crisper and clean, which is weird because I haven’t heard of any new models coming out. Weirder is that they are turned on. Anyone who’s got their hat powered on outside of work hours must be crazy. I guess they might literally have not heard me speak, though, the induced focus of the hat canceling out all unnecessary sound and sight. Whatever. In any case, resigning hopes for conversation, I light the cigarette I’m holding in my mouth, and sadly sigh through it until the tip glows a subdued, energetic orange, contrasting boldly with all my blue. I am filled, as I often am during these nocturnal hours, with a feeling of loneliness.</p><p>
                	As if moving at the persuasive hand of an invisible being, the cigarette smoke spirals and dances, quickly camouflaging with the rest of the gray except for the orange reflection from our intermittent drags, mixing with the hatted strangers’ smoke in the way our minds and bodies ought to be. Empty. Our lives are so empty, deprived of proper food, sleep, interaction, the whole deal. It leaves so much to be desired and dreamed. Empty. And routine, and inconsequential. At least we have cigarettes for occasional escapes, right?</p><p>
                	I continue to smoke until the bus arrives, an event which blows the cigarette smoke back into my face and stings my eyes. Tearing up, perhaps I would have cried if it would have done me any good, but who would even care? No one. Certainly not these two hatted jerks, nope. Instead, I drop my unfinished, wasted cigarette, grind it out with my heel, and hop on the bus.</p><p>
                	I pay to ride without advertisements because I’m unsure if I can endure them in my mood. Next to me sits a hatted woman dressed in scrubs who must be a doctor or nurse or something of the like. She too is staring ahead with the same blank stare as the two men from the bus stop (who now sit at the back of the bus), although this woman’s hat is not powered on. She probably should just be left alone as well I guess; I certainly don’t want to get ignored again. I just don’t get it. Does no one else desire to talk and interact as I do? No one talks, man! Not husbands and wives, not brothers and sisters, not friends. If you don’t speak, do you even have any relationships to begin with, or is no one anything more than a stranger? How can they be anything more? The very basis of friendship is conversation and understanding each other. Honestly, by that definition I’m not sure I really have any friends at all. I swear the only place I’ve been getting close to a decent conversation the past few months is at work, but then my mouth is puppeted by supervisors and thinking caps. Strangers? Forget about it. I can’t even seem to get eye contact with them let alone a response to a plea. We live today in a solo world. It’s absurd that it’s not only possible but also commonplace for me to make it through my entire day without it ever being necessary to speak to someone. I wonder if other companies are the same. But I don’t know.</p><p>
                	As I stare out the bus window, my eyes blur into memory. I think about years ago when I used to go to the grocery store and the clerk at the register would ask me how I’m doing and I usually would say ‘fine, you?’ and she’d say ‘alright’. Most of the time that would be it, but then occasionally I’d get asked why I was buying so much food compared to usual and I’d mention I was having some people over for dinner and a few drinks and say it was going to be a good time. She’d tell me to eat an extra slice of that pie for her at dessert and then laugh and it would be such a pointless interaction that, for some reason, would pop into my mind a few days later for me to reminisce. Yeah, I miss those pointless kinds of things. Even things that are valueless accrue interest over time. Oh, and the mailman, what was his name? I wonder if he ever found the recipient of the letters addressed to a non-existent room in my building. Those envelopes came all the time. Every time we saw each other we would share our stories about where the letters were coming from and who they were intended to be opened by. I always looked forward to his stories, they were creative. He told me once that he couldn’t ignore the chance a hitman was trying to kill him by sending poison-laced letters to a false address so that he would someday curiously open them, and bam! Dead. I liked to think the envelopes contained an allowance from a wealthy couple to their estranged son and that the mailman was unknowingly collecting a fortune. But he never would open them. Even when I told him opening them might help him figure out where they were supposed to go, he’d always say that he could never bring himself to break the promise of privacy between the postal service and the people. He was a good man. And, he said, he liked having a mystery to think about while driving his rounds. I don’t know if I agree about the wonder of a mystery, but then again since my job requires the electric hats, I can’t know the wonderful nature of a distraction. All work now is focused work.</p><p>
                	The bus lurches to a halt. Gray buildings are tinted red with frustrated brake lights and inattentive traffic signals. The night is, despite what is good for it, still active. People roam the streets, some looking for troubles and the others avoiding the ones that are. The footsteps of all the religious buildings are covered with restless, tattered blankets trying to get some sleep, some food perhaps, and undoubtedly some reprieve from their dejected lives. There is, in general, quite a lot of noise. Cars and traffic sounds, yes, but also a lot of distant yelling, never close but never far either. It’s pretty sad, really - the poor have been driven to crime just to stay alive, but yet are concealed to their own boroughs. There is always a fight going on somewhere, accusing an innocent friend of stealing and condemning another of an owed debt. It’s not safe to be out alone at night, especially in areas of town like this, especially when alone, especially if you have a hat. Hence why we take the buses. It’s just so different than it used to be. Darkness doesn’t resemble light same as the environment around me now seems foreign in comparison to the memories in my head.</p><p>
                	It’s not until we begin moving again that it becomes evident we had stopped to avoid two beggars who had wandered onto the street. I defensively turn my body to face more inside of the bus again, following the habit of avoiding eye contact with the poor, and turn into the eyes of the woman in scrubs I am sitting next to. Though retaining her emotionless yet dignified posture, a few stray tears had leaked out and fallen down her cheeks. Her eyes are those of a child. A sympathy is sparked within me that quickly flames into empathy, and I know what she feels. I feel it, too: this loneliness, this separation physically, emotionally, and socioeconomically that isolates us. What else can you feel now? Being around another emotional person, though, makes me feel inept and I don’t know how to respond or what to say. But looking at those eyes, it feels like I am looking at myself. I decide she, like myself, needs personal interaction to help diffuse the sorrow. Maybe we can talk together and feel better through our mutual position. But I don’t know.</p><p>
                	In a second or two I work up the gut to say, a little too weakly, “It’s okay, I get it.”</p><p>
                	She continues her silent crying, looking at some point in the distance or perhaps no point at all. But I will not give up this time, not twice in the same night. She needs to talk. “Hey, look...”</p><p>
                	“Stop.” She firmly and quickly admonishes, waving her hand at me and turning her head down. I feel sad. I don’t know what the right thing to do is, so I decide to say what I want someone to say to me.</p><p>
                	“You don’t have to be alone.”</p><p>
                    “Yeah? What’s the alternative, then? What else is there?” She looks at me expectantly, desperately even.</p><p>
                	I hesitate. “Well, I mean not everything is bad. There is still music and.... food... and painting and...”</p><p>
                	“All alone. And when even was the last time you painted?”</p><p>
                	“I...” I can’t remember the last time I had. I always want to, I always think about it, but I never seem to actually do it. I am always busy, or too tired, turning to some other pastime or just going to bed. But the time will come eventually, right? Somewhere in me a hope still preaches to my thoughts, swaying them with its evangelical optimism. The market will improve, the Stagnation will end. They have to. I don’t know what to say, and it is quiet until the doctor looks directly at me, through me, into me, as if she were diagnosing me with x-ray vision.</p><p>
                	“People need each other to survive, but it’s this union that makes us feel most alone. We think we are good for each other, but really we are symbiotic parasites. We aren’t what we make ourselves out to be. Scientists, researchers, doctors, and surgeons especially will say our insides are red and white. Blood and bone. But they’re wrong. On the inside we are all a deep blue. We are cold-blooded, us humans, seeking warmth to keep us alive, frantically scrambling free-for-all in an endless night to find some heat to keep alive. When day never comes, what happens then? What heat will warm us? This is a dangerous world. Much is out of our individual control. It will not be the smartest or the strongest who survive, it will be the ones who can tolerate the most pain, the ones aware of the deep inner blue, the ones who can foster the cold fire within and bring from it warmth. Stop waiting for the sun.”</p><p>
                	“I’m sorry, but what?” I ask, but she had already turned away to resume her stationary posture. Her eyes glaze over once more and the tears had dried to her cheeks. At a loss, I turn my head back towards the window and thankfully see my apartment complex crawling towards me. As I grab my bag and stand up to go on my way, a sense of relief washes over me to leave this nutjob doctor and the two men in the back of the bus with their hats still going. The hour’s interactions with strangers had only alienated me more and added to the loneliness. I take one last look at the woman next to me, perplexed, and then walk out of the bus and into the apartment building thinking of tears. What a shitty day it was. But, compared to those three, maybe I’ve got it better than most.</p><p>
                	I twist the key, flick the light switch, and enter my apartment, slugging my briefcase onto its spot on the bar stool at the high countertop connecting the small kitchen to the living room. Dishes lay scattered and distraught in the sink, casualties of the never-ending war between cleanliness and laziness, calling out for help to clean and disinfect their ailments and return them home to their families in the cabinetry above. With a gentle, fate-accepting sigh, I walk over to the stereo receiver in the living room and put on some music to play while I clean up the kitchen, hoping a little meditation will help my mood.</p><p>
                	Bernstein’s Serenade After Plato’s ‘Symposium’ begins. The solo violin calls out to me in its vibrating, longing voice, obsessively romantic, asking for love, for attention, for a companion. It doesn’t even matter who, just that someone listens and responds to the plea, the cupid’s call flying through the air towards me and asking me to respond. I soap the sponge and run the water to heat it up. Hum-singing, I join the violins in a response to the soloist in a lower pitched consolation, promising it will all improve, promising good times. The cellos come in with the violas, joining the sirenic call. I scrub away at a plate, and the conversation carries until it becomes strained, hectic. The full orchestra joins in suddenly, a massive forte. The soloist hits a high note frantically, exasperated, and the many voices of the orchestra tell the solo it’ll be okay. Thus, the wonderful exchange between lover and beloved ensues. I am the lover humming along, singing along, excitedly tapping my toe, knowing from many listens where it is all going and indulging myself in it even more fully as a result, following the violas then the bass then the soloist, hearing them out and letting the interaction take its course. I get chills that start hesitantly at my neck under the hairline and scatter up my scalp and down my spine in a fractal pattern to my arms and legs -- welcome chills, completely opposite from the punching, grinding ones of the thinking caps powering on. Yes, these are sensual and romantic, a lover’s hand caressing my neck as they go in for a kiss. And so as I scrub at the days-old crust on the dishes, I know only love, and for those thirty minutes my heart and mind are floating through a musical utopia, following a familiar story I’ve heard so many times but never grown tired of. As the conversation between lover and beloved in the serenade is of console and romance, so too is the singing conversation between the serenade itself and me. Everything feels okay, if even just for a little bit. How can I ever be lonely with music that speaks to me and talks to me so? Even if I’m surrounded by strangers, Bernstein is there for me, and Beethoven and Tchaikovsky and all the rest. This all might turn out okay.</p><p>
                	Inside my bedroom, I brush past easels and canvases and tubes of paint. They call for me but I do not answer. As I undress and eat a quick snack to get ready for bed, I consider picking up the paintbrush and expressing my feelings and frustrations in color; but, a tired brain needs sleep. Thus, I make the same decision as always: to go to bed instead of pursuing hobbies.</p><p>
                	I plug my hat into its charging port before climbing into bed, fearing it will be one of those nights where I cannot fall asleep. Perhaps it is exhaustion, or perhaps it is Bernstein hugging me tight, but whatever the cause I fall asleep quickly.</p><p>
